    "### 1. Purpose of Data Set\n",
    "The data set chosen for lab 1 is the 2015 Washington DC Metro Crime inspired from a Kaggle data set found at https://www.kaggle.com/vinchinzu/dc-metro-crime-data. The data set was obtained by following the steps found on the [Using the Crime Map Application](http://mpdc.dc.gov/node/200622) page. This site allowed us to download all eight wards from 01/01/2015 to 12/31/2015 as an exported CSV files. These individual ward files were then merged together into a single file for our use. This data set contains 36,493 entries and 18 attributes that are both continuous and discrete. This satisfies the data set requirement for a minimum of 30,000 entries and 10 attributes which are both continuous and discrete. Further definition of this data set will be discussed in the [Data Understanding](#data_understanding) section.\n",

    "<p style='text-align: center;'>\n",
    "Washington DC Metro Ward Map\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "The crime data is published by the Washington DC Metro police department daily (see below image) to provide their residents a clear picture of crime trends as they actually happen. The data is shared with its residents such as Advisory Neighborhood Commissions to help the police determine how to keep neighborhoods safe. The data is also analyzed to determine the effectiveness of current investments such as putting more officers on the streets, buying police more tools, and launching community partnerships, see [Washington DC Metro Police Department report](http://mpdc.dc.gov/publication/mpd-annual-report-2015) for more details.\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Importance of the Data Set\n",
    "This data set could be used to predict the number of violent and property crimes in police district given time of day, day of week, and other factors. This would allow the police department to appropriate adequate resources to each district to respond and possibly prevent the crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, this data set could be used to whether a crime at a location is violent or propery crime based on history of other crimes near this location. This would be valuable if a potential crime was reported but the reporter was unsure of the type of crime or if the crime reported was unusual for this location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Measurement of Importance\n",
    "The measurement of the importance would be to perform a validation on the machine learning model that was trained on the data set to predict the number of crimes that would be committed in a police district. If the crime prediction for a location was used, then the model would be trained and validated against crimes by location. The prediction error would be reported for both scenarios."
